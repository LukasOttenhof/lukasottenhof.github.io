          I am in my third year of studies taking computer science and math, at the 
          University of Alberta. Throughout my education
          I have strived to be the best learner I can and to be a strong member
          of the community. I have been at the top of my classes across a variety
          of subjects including, computer science classes, economic classes, and 
          community partnership classes. I have worked with community partners building
          apps, helped peers tutoring, and worked alongside professors. I have very strong team work
          skills that I have building my whole life whether in school projects, playing hockey, or
          at work.
