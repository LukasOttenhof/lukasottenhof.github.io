          Hello, my name is Lukas Ottenhof. I am a computer science and math student that is willing to put in hard
          work to learn new skills. I have experience using a variety of
          languages including java, javascript, python, HTML, CSS, and pep9. On
          this website you can see the code for various projects I have made
          such as this website, learn about my education, and a way to contact
          me.

          As a third-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Computing Science and
          Math degree at the University of Alberta, I have immersed myself in
          various computing projects, both independently and collaboratively. I
          have successfully developed functional products such as an android HR
          application for Wolsey Tech, a mobile gaming application, and several
          websites. Additionally, my coursework has equipped me with the skills
          needed to be an analytical thinker with the ability to be self-driven
          and capable of working in a fast-paced environment, as well as having
          proficiency in Microsoft Office applications. I am a patient,
          persistent person, who has a high level of attention to detail when
          working.
